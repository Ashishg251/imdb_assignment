I have completed the 2nd assignment IMDB Search App.
I have completed this assignment using jQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
I have used third APIs of IMDB i.e., from this website "http://www.myapifilms.com/".
My Folder is as follows:
		1. imdb.html : Main HTML file.
		2. imdb_style.css : CSS file inside css folder.
		3. imdb_actor_1.js : JavaScript file inside js folder.
		4. keystone-load.gif : one GF image inside images folder.
For running the project.
		1. Double -click on imdb.html and run it locally.
		2. In the given Search Box in the html file type the name of the actors/actresses and in the below given table you will get the name of the movies of that actor/actresses along with details.
Note: In the imdb.html some dummy text is given in the table. Please ignore that.
